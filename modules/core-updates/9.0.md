# Notable changes in PrestaShop 9.0

## PHP support

PrestaShop 9.0 now requires **PHP 8.1 minimum**, with support added for PHP 8.2 and 8.3.

- [Remove compatibility for php versions inferior to PHP 8.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32514)
- [Support for PHP 8.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29116)
- [Support for PHP 8.3](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34485)

## Core changes

### Symfony Upgrade

PrestaShop V9 has been upgraded to rely on Symfony 6.4, V8 was previously based on Symfony 4.4 so it's quite a big leap. As such the V9 includes all the breaking changes related to the Symfony Framework, you can see [more details about the changes in the core here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/33993) and if you can also check Symfony migration guides (see below).
Symfony 6.4 is the latest LTS version and will be supported until November 2026 for bug fixes, and November 2027 for security fixes.

### Removed dependencies

We followed Symfony recommendations and no longer use the `symfony/symfony` dependency but instead each sub package manually, the minimum version of PHP 8.1 also forced us to upgrade or removed some dependencies.
We used this occasion to clean the dependencies that are no longer used in the core (whether they are from symfony or not), if you need these dependencies in your modules you will have to integrate them in your module's dependencies.

- `guzzlehttp/guzzle` (replaced by Symfony HTTP client in the core)
- `league/tactician-bundle` (replaced by Symfony Messenger component)
- `pear/archive_tar`
- `sensio/framework-extra-bundle` (we now favor annotations in the core)
- `soundasleep/html2text`
- `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` (replaced by Symfony Mailer component in the core)
- `symfony/inflector`
- `symfony/notifier`
- `symfony/rate-limiter`
- `symfony/semaphore`
- `symfony/uid`
- `symfony/workflow`

{{% notice note %}}
**Mail SSL encryption was dropped**

When we were migrating Swift mailer to Symfony Mailer, we noticed that ssl support was not an option in ESMTP transport. Also SSL is an old and outdated encryption type. For security reasons, it will not be allowed anymore.

The remaining choices are tls encryption or no encryption.

- 'egulias/email-validator': `3.2.6` -> `4.0.1`

### Symfony controllers

In Symfony 6.4, the controllers must now be defined as services. The impact on the existing controllers is mainly around the concept of Dependency Injection and how services are injected or accessed in the controllers.
The container passed to the controllers is no longer the "global container" that contains all the existing services in the application. Instead, it injects a dedicated container optimized for the controller based on the services that are injected into it.

The issue is that most of PrestaShop's Symfony controllers do not rely on injection but instead use the `$this->get('service_name')` method to access any service. This is no longer possible in modern controllers because of the mentioned optimization related to container build (and the `get` method was even removed).
To avoid a very big breaking change, we modified the `PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\FrameworkBundleAdminController`, so that it can fetch services from the controller's container **and** from the global one, but this is a little hack that goes against Symfony recommendations, as such this base class is already **deprecated and will be removed in PrestaShop 10.0**.

This gives developers some time to refacto their controllers. They should now rely on the new `PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\PrestaShopAdminController`, which doesn't implement the mentioned hack in order to force a proper implementation of the controllers.
You can read more details about <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/controller/service.html" target="_blank">Controllers as services</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/service_container/service_subscribers_locators.html" target="_blank">Service Subscribers & Locators</a> or <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/service_container.html">Service container</a> in general.

As an example, you have three main possibilities to inject a service into your controller:

```php
<?php

use PrestaShopBundle\Controller\Admin\PrestaShopAdminController;

class MyController extends PrestaShopAdminController
{
    /**
     * You can inject your service systematically in the constructor, useful if the service is used by several actions of your controller.
     * 
     * @param MyCustomService $myCustomService
     */
    public function __construct(
      private readonly MyCustomService $myCustomService,
    ) {
    }
    
    /**
     * You can inject a service only on one method, useful if the service is used only in one action. It is more optimized than injecting it all the time and never using it.
     * 
     * @param MySpecificService $specificService
     * @return JsonResponse
     */
    public function indexAction(MySpecificService $specificService): JsonResponse
    {
        $generalData = $this->myCustomerService->getData();
        $specificData = $specifiService->getSpecificData();

        // You can use the get method to fetch a service that was added in the getSubscribedServices method
        $toolingService = $this->container->get(ToolingService::class);
        
        return new JsonResponse($toolingService->format($generalData + $specificData));
    }
    
    /**
     * You can define a list of registered services, they will be accessible via the $this->container->get method, this
     * way of injecting service is interesting if implemented on a base controller class for generic services that
     * may be used by many controllers (like the router, the translator, ...) so you don't need to inject them manually
     * in each controller class.
     * 
     * @return array
     */
    public static function getSubscribedServices(): array
    {
        return parent::getSubscribedServices() + [
            ToolingService::class => ToolingService::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

**Define your controller as a service**

You can already anticipate and define your controllers as services, it is also compatible with previous versions of Symfony and PrestaShop:

```yaml
services:
  MyNamespace\MyController:
    # Using autowire will inject services in the constructors automatically
    autowire: true
    # Using autoconfigure with controllers that extend AbstractController will handle method parameter injection and subscribed services
    autoconfigure: true
    # If your controller class doesn't extend AbstractController you should add this tag manually so you benefit from method parameters injection
    tags: ['controller.service_arguments']
```

{{% notice note %}}
**PrestaShopAdminController::getSubscribedServices**

The new base controller class uses the `getSubscribedServices` method to give easy access to some commonly used PrestaShop services, like the `ConfigurationInterface`, `HookDispatcherInterface`, `TranslatorInterface`, ...
You can see the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/9.0.0-alpha.1/src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin/PrestaShopAdminController.php#L59" target="_blank">full list of subscribed services</a> in the class, this list will probably grow piece by piece but only for common generic services.
<br/><br/>
Thanks to this, you can use `$this->container->get(ConfigurationInterface::class)->get('my_config')` to access the configuration service, or alternatively use the helper method `$this->getConfiguration()->get('my_config')`.
The `PrestaShopAdminController` class comes with other helpful helper methods that are commonly used in controllers.

### Kernel modifications

Until PrestaShop 8.0, we relied on one Kernel used for the back office. In Symfony 9.0, we expanded the usage of the Symfony framework, especially for two new features:
- the new Admin API based on API Platform and OAuth authentication
- an experimental feature that gives access to a Symfony container in the front office (in opposition to the custom-built container available today). This one is not very much used yet, but it's a first stone for the future front office migration

Those two new environments have mechanisms and configuration different from those in the back office. To separate these configurations cleanly, they each have their dedicated kernel class and their own configuration. This allows to cleanly define different routing, security configurations, dedicated services, listeners, ...
Each kernel has a unique `applicationId` that allows to dynamize its configuration and cache folder (since the services are not the same, each kernel needs its own cache folder). The `appId` parameter has also been added globally to the `bin/console` tool. They all share the common `app/config/config.yml` configuration file, but each one extends it in its own config folder.

| Environment                 | Kernel class     | Config folder          | Cache folder                          | Endpoint               | Application ID |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Back office                 | `AdminKernel`    | `app/config/admin`     | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/admin`     | `/admin-dev/index.php` | `admin`        |
| Admin API                   | `AdminAPIKernel` | `app/config/admin-api` | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/admin-api` | `/admin-api/index.php` | `admin-api`    |
| Front office (experimental) | `FrontKernel`    | `app/config/front`     | `var/cache/{dev,prod,test}/front`     | `/index.php`           | `front`        |

{{% notice note %}}
**Console usage**

Clear the cache of the Admin API for its `prod` environment

`php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod --app-id=admin-api`

Display event listeners for the back office in `dev` environment (default value of `app-id` is `admin` for retro compatibility)

`php bin/console debug:event-dispatcher kernel.request --env=dev`

### Symfony layout

All the back office pages share a common layout, composed of a few elements:
- the `<head>` element that includes all the CSS and JS (among other things)
- the side navigation menu
- the header of the page which is itself composed of:
  - quick accesses
  - search form
  - notifications center
  - employee dropdown
  - the multistore header (when multistore is enabled)
  - the page toolbar (which includes breadcrumb and top action buttons)
- the footer (which only contains a displayBackOfficeFooter display hook)

Until PrestaShop 8.1, all these common elements were handled by legacy code, so even on the migrated pages, there was always a background legacy controller based on `AdminController` in charge of building the layout data and rendering it. Once the layout was rendered the central content of Symfony pages was included in the middle of it. It means no page was completely free from the legacy controllers, which would ultimately block the end of migration, while they are intended to disappear completely.

In PrestaShop 9.0 all this layout part is now fully handled by Symfony, we use <a href="https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html" target="_blank">Twig components</a> to render each element independently. The code is, therefore, easier to understand, a component class is responsible for fetching/building the data, while the actual rendering is based on Twig. See our <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/Twig/Component" target="_blank">Layout components</a> for more details.

On legacy pages, we follow the same principle. Symfony is now in charge of rendering all the layout, and we use some <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/Twig/Component/Legacy" target="_blank">Legacy layout components</a> that follow the same architecture, but render different Twig templates to fit with the old **default theme** (that is based on old Bootstrap and includes old legacy helpers like `HelperForm` and `HelperList`).

**What changes for my module pages?**

We refactored this layout with maximum backward compatibility in mind. The HTML layout itself had minimum changes (in both migrated and legacy pages). We tried to keep the same hooks in both the PHP code and the Twig templates. We even introduced a fake legacy controller in migrated pages that has no logic but is kept mostly as a [DTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) to contain things like CSS files and JS files, because that's where most modules add their content.
We still had to change the controller workflow. Many of the functions in `AdminController` are no longer useful as they are used to initialize the layout variables (now handled by Twig components). Some methods also render or write output directly, which we prevent as we need to get the rendered content as a string to integrate it correctly inside the new layout. This means some internal methods had to be split to avoid unwanted usage.

**Legacy workflow:**

- `Dispatcher::dispatch` would detect the legacy controller and instantiate it
- `AdminController::run` was executed by the `Dispatcher`, which was split into
  - `AdminController::init`
  - `AdminController::checkAccess` would handle the check of the legacy token in the url
  - `AdminController::setMedia` is in charge of defining the JS/CSS files to be loaded in the page
  - `AdminController::postProcess` processes the posted data
    - if after this method `AdminController::redirect_after` is defined then perform an HTTP redirection
  - `AdminController::initHeader`
  - `AdminController::initContent`
  - `AdminController::initFooter`
  - Check if `AdminController::ajax`, one of the two is executed
    - `AdminController::displayAjax` (or specific `displayAjax{action}` method)
    - `AdminController::display`
      - init many variables used by the layout templates (meta title, toolbar, JS definitions, ...)
      - render `page`, `header`, `footer` and sets them as Smarty variables
      - fetch the Smarty `AdminController::template` to get the content of the page
      - calls `smartyOutputContent` to echo/output the whole page (layout + content)

Here you'll find the [execution workflow of legacy controllers]({{< relref "9/development/architecture/legacy/legacy-controllers.md" >}})

**Symfony workflow:**

- A special routing matching URLs like `?controller=LegacyAdminController` checks if the URL is valid thanks to `LegacyRouterChecker::check`
  - the query parameter must match an existing legacy controller class
  - the controller object is instantiated and `AdminController::init` is called, this is important to know if the controller is anonymous, this is the proper moment to define `AdminController::allowAnonymous`
  - a few attributes are set on the Symfony `Request` so they can be reused later in the workflow by other components/services
- `LegacyController::legacyPageAction` is a generic controller responsible for executing the legacy controller, it doesn't execute `AdminController::run` but splits it into several steps
  - `AdminController::checkAccess` is not called, the token in URLs is a Symfony CSRF token now and is checked by `TokenizedUrlListener`
  - `LegacyController::initController`
    - the permission is checked based on the detected controller and action, unless `AdminController::viewAccess` has been overridden in which case it is used to check authorization
    - `SmartyVariablesFiller::fillDefault` is in charge of building most of the generic smarty variables previously handled by `AdminController::initHeader`
    - `AdminController::setMedia` is in charge of defining the JS/CSS files to be loaded in the page
    - `AdminController::postProcess` processes the posted data
      - if after this method `AdminController::redirect_after` is defined then perform an HTTP redirection
  - Check if `ajax` query parameter is defined, one of the two is executed
    - `LegacyController::renderAjaxController` executes `AdminController::initContent` the appropriate `AdminController::displayAjax` method, it catches all the output data into a string buffer (because most legacy ajax methods simply echo their content) and returns it as a response
    - `LegacyController::renderPageContent`
      - executes `AdminController::initContent`
      - fetch the Smarty `AdminController::template` to get the content of the page
      - calls `Cookie::write` which was previously called via `smartyOutputContent`
      - get the modal content via `AdminController::renderModal`

The two workflows should render the same result. Many methods from the legacy workflow are not executed anymore because they lost their purpose, but in case you override one of those methods, be aware that they are no longer called directly, so there are breaking changes:
- `AdminController:run`
- `AdminController::initHeader`
- `AdminController::initContent`
- `AdminController::initFooter`
- `AdminController:display`

Also, be aware that many Smarty variables are no longer defined because they were only used to render the layout.

Despite the changes in the workflow and the fact we no longer depend on the `Dispatcher` class, we **maintained** these hooks:
- `actionDispatcher`
- `actionDispatcherBefore`
- `actionDispatcherAfter`

### BO login and authorization migrated to Symfony

The back office login page has been migrated to Symfony. Along with this change, the authorization system in the back office is now also based on Symfony, which implies several things:
- we no longer depend on the legacy `Context::$cookie`, the session is kept on the server side, and very few data are kept on the browser side. For retro-compatibility, we still populate the legacy cookie so that you can **read** it. While you can use `Context::$cookie` for your custom data, making changes to the data previously used for PrestaShop authorization will no longer have the desired effect and may even result in instability, so it's not recommended
- the `PrestaShopBundle\Security\Admin\EmployeeProvider` and `PrestaShopBundle\Service\DataProvider\UserProvider` now return a `PrestaShopBundle\Entity\Employee` instance, their responsibility is to return a `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface` anyway (and they still do) but in case you depended on the child class know that `PrestaShopBundle\Security\Admin\Employee` no longer exist
- if you need to get the logged-in user, you can use the Symfony `Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Security` service, but we recommend you use the `EmployeeContext` internal PrestaShop service (see explanation about [new Contexts]({{< relref "9/modules/core-updates/9.0.md#symfony-context-refacto" >}}))

**Storing custom data in Session**

If you need to persist some custom Employee data, we don't recommend using the `Context::$cookie` anymore, instead you can use the `Session` from Symfony and update its attributes:

```php
// In Symfony controllers, you can get the session from the Request parameter injected by Symfony
$session = $request->getSession();

// In other services you will need to get the current request via the RequestStack service
$request = $requestStack->getCurrentRequest();
if ($request) {
  $session = $request->getSession();
}

// You can then get/set a custom attribute, but you should always check that the session object is indeed available. Some requests do not rely on the session, and it may never be created
if ($session) {
  // Be careful to use a custom and UNIQUE attribute name
  $myData = $session->getAttribute('my_custom_data');
  // The session object will be automatically serialized at the end of the request, and automatically unserialized at the beginning of the next requests
  $session->setAttribute('my_custom_data', 'updated value');
}
```

{{% notice note %}}
The Symfony session has other interesting features (like flash bags for unique usage data). You can read more about its usage in the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/session.html" target="_blank">Session documentation</a>.
{{% /notice %}}

**Removed hooks:**
- `actionAdminLoginControllerBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerLoginBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerLoginAfter`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerForgotBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerForgotAfter`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerResetBefore`
- `actionAdminLoginControllerResetAfter`

**Hooks kept for backward compatibility:**
- `actionAdminLoginControllerSetMedia` so you can add some custom assets on the login page
- `displayAdminLogin` so you can add custom HTML on the login page

**New hooks**
- `actionBackOfficeLoginForm` to modify the login form (the form builder is passed via the `form_builder` hook parameter)
- `actionEmployeeRequestPasswordResetForm` to modify the request password form (the form builder is passed via the `form_builder` hook parameter)

The login logic, however, is not handled by PrestaShop's internal code so there is no handler that interprets the submitted data (and that's why there are so few new hooks). Instead we rely on <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#form-login" target="_blank">Symfony form login authentication system</a>, so it's Symfony's internal system that interprets the data submitted, validates it and authenticate the employee to the back office.

If you need to integrate your code with the authentication process you should now rely on the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/security.html#authentication-events" target="_blank">Authentication events</a> described in their documentation, you can also inspire yourself from our <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/src/PrestaShopBundle/EventListener/Admin/EmployeeSessionSubscriber.php" target="_blank">own internal subscriber</a>.

### Symfony context refacto

A significant amount of code in the core relies on the legacy `Context` class, which stores certain data as a singleton. However, this legacy implementation has many drawbacks, so refactoring was initiated in PrestaShop 9.0 to replace this usage.
You can find more details about the reason behind this and the implementation in the related <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ADR/blob/master/0024-context-refacto.md" traget="_blank">ADR about Context refactoring</a>.

You should now favor using the modern split context services:

- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\ApiClientContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\CountryContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\CurrencyContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\EmployeeContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\LanguageContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\LegacyControllerContext`
- `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Context\ShopContext`

We still have some work to do to replace all the usages of the legacy context with the modern ones, but the new code will stop using the legacy ones. We recommend that developers rely on the new ones from now on.

- [ShopContext and EmployeeContext](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/33223)
- [CurrencyContext and CountryContext](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34147)
- [LanguageContext (implied modifications on LanguageInterface and LocaleInterface)](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34500)
- [ApiClientContext](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34892)
- [LegacyControllerContext](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34390)

## Migrated pages

The migration of pages imply several breaking changes, we won't detail all of them for each page but here is a summary:
- the legacy URL is no longer reachable, you are automatically redirected to the migrated page
- the legacy controller is removed along with its associated smarty templates
- the legacy hooks related to controller workflow are no longer called
- the page no longer uses smarty but twig

Here is the list of migrated pages in v9:

- International > Locations > States
- Shop parameters > Order settings > Statuses
- Orders > Shopping Carts
- Sell > Catalog > Attributes
- Sell > Catalog > Feature
- Sell > Catalog > Products (new version of the page introduce in PrestaShop V8 is now the only available one)
  - [edition of features use a new optimized data structure in the form](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34763)

## Breaking Changes

### `trans` method

Following [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#30415](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30415) the function `trans()` does NOT escape anymore strings. In v8 you could pass parameters like `htmspecialcharacters` or `addslashes` to `trans()` to perform additional escape, but it’s been removed.
It also affects the `l` function in Smarty.

Since [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#30415](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31900) the `trans` method always keep the behavior it had with the (now removed) `_raw` parameter, meaning the content is not modified anymore. You need to use `htmlspecialchars` on your parameters provided on input and on the returned string if you need to modify it.

### Some front controller now use `Presenter` classes

This changes the data passed to the smarty templates:

- [Category](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32653)
- [Manufacturer](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31309)
- [Supplier](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32634)
